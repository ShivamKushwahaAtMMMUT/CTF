A Night at the Museum</center>
</h2>

<h4 style="color: teal;">Robert Sedgewick was a computer expert with expertise in esoteric languages and enigmatic codes. He was one of the best in his field.
 He was also a historic egghead well versed in greek-roman history and mythology .One evening he was sitting in his study waiting for his girlfriend
Lucy to go for the monthly visit to the museum.Suddenly, he heard the sound of Police siren wailing in his neighbourhood and sound of many footsteps approaching
at his gate. He was bewildered from these sound effects and in distraught state went to his doorstep where he saw two policemen coming towards his house .
Both of them were colossal ,one of them banged at the door and asked for Robert. Robert was afraid and replied with a meek voice and affirmative nod. 
He was handed a letter and was requested to come to the museum .He was once again shocked as he was thinking about the museum itself .While travelling in 
the police interceptor he knew about the incident that Lucy was kidnapped and the kidnappers wanted a series of puzzles to be solved at the museum and it 
required a person of his calibre and skill set. He opened the letter and read it .
